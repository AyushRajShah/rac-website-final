          Robotics and Automation center (RAC) at Thapathali Campus, TU offers a
          wide range of programs for students interested in robotics and
          automation. The center provides courses in Robotics and Automation,
          Control Systems, Mechatronics, and Artificial Intelligence. These
          courses offer students practical knowledge in the field, preparing
          them for a career in the industry. The center also provides research
          opportunities for students, and they are guided by experienced faculty
          members. Students from the Automobile and Mechanical, Industrial,
          Electronics, and Computer engineering departments work cohesively in
          Robotics and Automation Center for various projects and competitions.
          RAC&apos;s inclusive approach is reflected in its diverse membership,
          welcoming students from every faculty within our campus. This
          interdisciplinary collaboration fosters a vibrant environment where
          individuals from various backgrounds contribute their unique
          perspectives and expertise to the field of robotics. Through their
          tireless efforts, RAC has solidified its position as a pioneering
          force in the realm of robotics and technology, leaving an indelible
          mark on the landscape of innovation within our campus and beyond. In
          addition to programs, the RAC at Thapathali Campus also organizes
          competitions and training programs for students. In the academic year
          2079, RAC participated, organized, and won several competitions
          including the International Micro mouse Challenge held at IIT Bombay
          with the first runner-up position. It also organized Robotic Week
          Jestha 29-3 Ashar, which was a great opportunity for students to
          showcase their skills and knowledge in the field. Furthermore, it has
          organized a one-week training program on Aeromodelling and PCB design
          and fabrication, allowing students to learn and experiment with the
          latest technology. These programs and competitions were a great way
          for students to gain practical experience, showcase their skills, and
          learn from industry experts.
